Description: Provides ensemble samplers for
    affine-invariant Monte Carlo Markov Chain, which allow a faster
    convergence for badly scaled estimation problems. Two samplers are
    proposed: the 'differential.evolution' sampler from ter Braak and
    Vrugt (2008) <doi:10.1007/s11222-008-9104-9> and the 'stretch' sampler
    from Goodman and Weare (2010) <doi:10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65>.
